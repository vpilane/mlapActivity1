    <h1>Challenges Facing African IT Professionals</h1>
    <p id="description">
        IT professionals in Africa face both global tech challenges and unique regional issues tied to infrastructure, economy, policy, and education
    </p>
    <div id="cont">
        
        <h3 id ="h1">1. Limited Infrastructure</h3>
        <p id="p1">
            Unreliable electricity supply affects uptime and productivity.<br>
            Slow or expensive internet in many rural and even urban areas.<br>
            Limited access to modern hardware or cloud data centers.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="h2">2. High Cost and Low Access to Technology</h3>
        <p id="p2">
            Imported hardware and software are costly due to taxes and weak local currency.<br>
            Licensing costs for essential software can be prohibitive.<br>
            Cloud services like AWS or Azure may have fewer local data centers, increasing latency and costs.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="h3">3. Skills Gap and Limited Training</h3>
        <p id="p3">
            Shortage of advanced tech training (e.g., AI, cybersecurity, DevOps).<br>
            Brain drain: skilled professionals leave for better opportunities abroad.<br>
            Lack of structured mentorship and internship programs for junior talent.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="h4">4. Limited Job Opportunities and Underemployment</h3>
        <p id="p4">
            Many IT graduates face unemployment or are hired into non-technical roles.<br>
            Startup ecosystems are growing, but still limited outside major cities like Nairobi, Lagos, Cape Town, etc.<br>
            Job offers may not match the effort and skill level required.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="h5">5. Cybersecurity Risks and Weak Policies</h3>
        <p id="p5">
            Growing cybercrime, but low awareness in companies and public institutions.<br>
            Weak enforcement of data protection laws (though countries like South Africa have POPIA).<br>
            Many SMEs donâ€™t prioritize cybersecurity due to budget constraints.<br>
